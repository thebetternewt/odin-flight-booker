# Odin Flight Booker

Odin Flight Booking is a toy application completed in conjunction with [TheOdinProject](http://theodinproject.com)'s Ruby on Rails [Advanced Forms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav) project.

## Users are able to:

* Search available flights.

* Pick a flight.

* Book a flight for multiple passengers.

* Enter in details for each passenger.

* View their booked flights.

## The code displays my understanding of:

* Advanced forms.

* Nested forms (`accepts_nested_attributes_for`).

* Creating, editing, and deleting objects through `has_many` and `has_many_through` relationships.
